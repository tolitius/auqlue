# auqlue

Conference talk, company meeting, you present, people listening. Someone is brave enough to interrupt and ask a question, somebody is to shy, someone has a flaky remote Skype/Hangout/phone connection.

But questions are _very_ important: for people who listen in, for a speaker, as well as for the whole event, whether it is a small meeting of 5 people, or a conference talk with thousands local and remote.

There are just too many questions that stay "unasked" and more importantly _unanswered_ due to all the above: auqlue is here to change that!

##What is Auqlue?

Auqlue "takes its roots" from the "*A*nswer to the *U*ltimate *Q*uestion of *L*ife, the *U*niverse, and *E*verything". It allows a presenter/speaker, with "a single click", to create a question platform (later "auqlue") dedicated to the specific meeting or talk.

This particular "auqlue" can be shared by the speaker with all the participants, and will enable people to just type their questions in, and vote for questions from other people.

A speaker can chose when to answer these questions, it can be during a talk, at the end of a talk, after a talk, etc..

##Show me what you mean..

Sure, here is what Auqlue looks like:

Once you enter a presentation name (optionally a speaker and an event), click "Create Auqlue" and a new auqlue will be created for this event. Let's pretend you entered "Simple Made Easy", "Rich Hickey", "Strange Loop" accordingly:

This can be shared with anyone who'd like to participate. Now click on that link and enable people to really get curious:
